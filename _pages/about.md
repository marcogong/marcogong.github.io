Welcome to my website!

I am a second-year master's student in mechanical engineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland. My research interests are deep learning-based smart perception and planning for robotic devices.

At EPFL, I took part in the visual localization algorithm development for drones at [TOPO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/topo/) lab, supervised by [Dr. Iordan](https://people.epfl.ch/iordan.doytchinov). Additionally, I worked on reinforcement learning w/ contrastive learning at [VITA](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/) lab, supervised by [Prof. Alexandre](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi).

I finished my undergraduate study at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019, with a major in nuclear engineering and technology. During the period, I worked on cooperative localization algorithm with [Prof. Solmaz Kia](http://solmaz.eng.uci.edu/) at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) and manipulator control with [Prof. Xianghui Meng](http://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/mengxianghui.html) at SJTU.
