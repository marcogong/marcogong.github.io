Hello World! I am an incoming PhD candidate at the [Department of Computing](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). My research interests span the fields of cybersecurity, data-driven privacy, data profiling, networked systems, and mobile computing.

At PolyU, my research is mainly under the supervision of [Dr.Ray Young](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csyanglei/#/pages/profile/about), who leads a resarch team called Tagsys. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree at [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in computer science and cyberspace security, respectively. At XDU, I work closely with [Dr.Hui Li](https://lihuixidian.github.io/) for 4 years.
