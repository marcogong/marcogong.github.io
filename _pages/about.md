Welcome to my personal website!

I am a second year master student in mechanical engineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). My research interests are the deep learning-based smart perception and planning for robotic devices.

I finished my undergraduate study at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019, with a major in Nuclear Engineering and Technology. Previously, I worked on cooperative localization algorithm with [Prof. Solmaz Kia](http://solmaz.eng.uci.edu/) at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) and manipulator control with [Prof. Xianghui Meng](http://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/mengxianghui.html) at SJTU.
