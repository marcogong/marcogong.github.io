## Sports 

I am a big fan of football. I support [Manchester United](http://www.manutd.com/) since I was 10. Although Manchester United is still at the bottom of Sir Ferguson’s retirement, Ole’s coaching has shown me the dawn of a revival. Currently, my favorite players in Manchester United are Bruno Fernandes, Edinson Cavani, and Harry Maguire. At the same time, I am also full of respect for Jose Mourinho, who lead United to win 3 trophies in 2017. Anyway, GGMU!

I also take a keen interest in NBA. Stephen Curry and his Warriors are my favorite. Besides, I love [Steve Nash](https://stevenash.org/about-steve/) and his Phoenix Suns.

Don't think that I will only watch football in front of TV, I will also play football on the court. I have played for the Xidian University Football Club many times. I can play as a winger or as an attacking midfielder. Despite the mediocre physical talent, excellent dribbling, wide vision, and accurate passing are my advantages. Most importantly, for a good football player, a smart brain full of creativity is a must.
